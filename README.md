- 👋 Hi, I’m @WHS-Phoenix
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming and asset creation for Generations Arena, a Quake 3 Arena nostalgia modification.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the IOQuake3 source .
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing really, but I'll accept/provide advice on Q3A's source code and modding in general.
- 📫 How to reach me ... visit www.wireheadstudios.org or message me on the IOQuake3 discord server.
